# context-aware-toxicity1

Abstract

In recent years, the proliferation of social media platforms has led to an increase in toxic behavior, which can have detrimental effects on user experience and mental health. This project aims to develop a context-aware toxicity detection system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify harmful content in social media interactions. Traditional toxicity detection models often rely solely on the textual content of individual messages, neglecting the surrounding context that can significantly influence the interpretation of language. By incorporating contextual factors such as conversation history, user sentiment, and topic relevance, our approach seeks to enhance the accuracy of toxicity detection while minimizing false positives. We utilize a dataset derived from the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, which provides a rich source of labeled comments for training and evaluation. Our methodology includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like BERT. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in detection performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the importance of context in understanding toxicity. This project not only contributes to the field of NLP but also offers practical implications for moderating online interactions, fostering healthier social media environments. Ultimately, our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware approaches in addressing the challenges posed by toxic behavior in digital communication.
